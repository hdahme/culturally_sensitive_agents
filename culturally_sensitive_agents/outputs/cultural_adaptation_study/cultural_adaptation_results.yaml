      adapted_response: "When negotiating a salary increase in South Korea, it is\
        \ important to approach the discussion with respect for hierarchy and authority.\
        \ Here is a culturally appropriate way to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Prepare\
        \ Thoroughly**: Before approaching your superior, gather data on your contributions,\
        \ achievements, and market standards for your role. It is helpful to align\
        \ your request with how your work supports the company's goals and collective\
        \ success.\n\n2. **Choose the Right Time**: Timing is crucial. Request a meeting\
        \ during a period when your superior is less likely to be stressed or preoccupied\
        \ with other tasks.\n\n3. **Use Formal Language and Titles**: Address your\
        \ superior with their last name followed by their title, e.g., \"Manager Kim\"\
        . Begin the conversation by expressing gratitude for their support and the\
        \ opportunities given to you.\n\n4. **Emphasize Group Benefit**: Frame your\
        \ request in terms of how your continued dedication will benefit the team\
        \ and the organization. For instance, \"By allowing me this increase, I can\
        \ further contribute to our department\u2019s success.\"\n\n5. **Indirect\
        \ Approach**: Instead of directly demanding a salary hike, express your interest\
        \ in discussing your career development, which includes potential salary adjustments.\
        \ This indicates a long-term commitment.\n\n6. **Be Modest and Humble**: Showcase\
        \ your achievements subtly and focus on future potential. Avoid being boastful\
        \ about individual successes.\n\n7. **Express Understanding**: End the discussion\
        \ by acknowledging any constraints they may face and expressing willingness\
        \ to understand the company's perspective. For example, \"I appreciate the\
        \ opportunity to discuss this, and I understand if there are considerations\
        \ we need to take into account.\"\n\nFollowing these steps, you will demonstrate\
        \ respect for the company\u2019s hierarchy while effectively advocating for\
        \ your interests within the cultural context of South Korea."

        1. **Respect Positions**: Address your colleague with appropriate titles such

        3. **Non-Verbal Cues**: Maintain a polite demeanor, with subtle nods and attentive
        body language. This respectfulness in conduct indicates sincerity and a desire
        to maintain harmony.


        4. **Contextual and Relational**: Understand their role within the hierarchy
        and approach with a sense of collaboration, citing shared goals. "Our collective
        aim to improve team performance could benefit from reviewing..."


        5. **Focus on Relationship**: Build a rapport by expressing appreciation for
        their previous contributions. "You''ve always been a cornerstone for our team,
        and your inputs are invaluable."


        6. **Loyalty to Family and Collectivism**: Reflect mutual respect and support,
        valuing the relationship beyond the immediate feedback session. Engage in
        small talk about family or common interests beforehand to set a comfortable
        tone.


        By being considerate of the power distance and employing a respectful, indirect
